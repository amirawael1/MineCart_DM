Bundle and Cross-Selling Recommendation System Using Product Metadata
MineCart_DM Project Report

Abstract—This report presents a bundle and cross-selling recommendation system built for Amazon product data. The approach integrates content-based similarity from product titles, category-aware bundle construction, and association-rule signals to generate coherent, diverse, and price-aware bundles. The system targets a practical gap in the literature: many recommender and bundle systems depend on user–item interactions, while metadata-only scenarios are less studied. The implementation is provided in a single notebook with reproducible analysis steps.

Index Terms—recommender systems, cross-selling, bundle recommendation, association rules, word embeddings, content-based filtering.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recommender systems often rely on user behavior or transaction logs to infer preferences and co-purchase patterns. In sparse or cold-start environments, such data may be unavailable, while product metadata is still accessible. This project addresses that limitation by using product titles, categories, prices, and ratings to construct a hybrid recommendation pipeline. The goal is to support bundle construction and cross-selling without dependence on dense interaction data.

II. RELATED WORK AND RESEARCH GAP
Association Rules / Market Basket Analysis
[1] R. Agrawal, T. Imieliński, and A. Swami, “Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases,” SIGMOD, 1993.
Focus: discovering frequent item co-occurrences from transaction logs. Gap addressed: transaction data may be limited; this project integrates metadata-based similarity and price-aware bundling.

[2] R. Agrawal and R. Srikant, “Fast algorithms for mining association rules,” VLDB, 1994.
Focus: efficient rule mining at scale. Gap addressed: rule mining alone does not model semantic similarity or pricing constraints.

Recommender Systems / Cross-Selling
[3] B. Sarwar, G. Karypis, J. Konstan, and J. Riedl, “Item-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms,” WWW, 2001.
Focus: item–item similarity from user interactions. Gap addressed: collaborative filtering depends on interaction data; this project provides a metadata-first alternative.

[4] G. Linden, B. Smith, and J. York, “Amazon.com recommendations: Item-to-item collaborative filtering,” IEEE Internet Computing, 2003.
Focus: large-scale item-to-item recommendations from purchase history. Gap addressed: sparse histories benefit from content-based similarity and category-aware bundles.

Hybrid Recommenders
[5] R. Burke, “Hybrid recommender systems: Survey and experiments,” User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 2002.
Focus: combining recommendation strategies. Gap addressed: hybrid designs commonly emphasize user–item data; this project uses product metadata and bundle constraints.

Focus: word embeddings for semantic similarity. Gap addressed: embeddings are adapted to product-title similarity to support cross-selling without user logs.

III. DATASET
Files:
• data/amazon_products_cleaned.csv
• data/amazon_categories.csv

Key fields used: ASIN, title, category ID/name, price, list price, star rating, review count, recent purchase activity.

IV. METHODOLOGY
A. Data Cleaning
• Normalize titles and remove punctuation.
• Convert numeric fields (price, stars, reviews).
• Impute missing values and remove incomplete records.

B. Exploratory Analysis
• Category distribution.
• Price and rating patterns.
• Top categories and sales indicators.

C. Feature Engineering
• Discount percentage and popularity proxies.
• Cleaned text for NLP features.

D. Clustering (TF‑IDF + Numeric Features)
• TF‑IDF vectors from product titles.
• Optional clustering to surface natural bundle groupings.

E. Content-Based Similarity (Word2Vec)
• Load a pre-trained Word2Vec model.
• Generate title embeddings.
• Combine embeddings with normalized price features.
• Compute cosine similarity for cross-selling recommendations.

F. Association Rule Mining (Apriori)
• Generate or simulate transaction baskets for co-purchase patterns.
• Mine frequent itemsets and association rules.
• Use lift and confidence for bundle candidate pairs.

G. Category Co‑Occurrence Analysis
• Build category-level co‑purchase matrices.
• Identify frequently co‑occurring categories for bundle diversity.

H. Bundle Generator
Bundles are generated with constraints:
• Anchor product similarity (content-based).
• Category diversity to avoid redundancy.
• Price ceiling to keep bundles marketable.
• Minimum rating threshold for quality.

I. Cross-Sell Recommender
A hybrid scoring strategy combines:
• Content similarity (Word2Vec).
• Category proximity.
• Popularity indicators.

V. EVALUATION
Bundle quality is assessed using:
• Diversity (unique categories per bundle).
• Coherence (average pairwise similarity).
• Value (average rating and popularity).
• Price efficiency (bundle price vs. sum of individual prices).

VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
• The hybrid approach produces coherent yet diverse bundles.
• Price-aware constraints prevent impractical bundles.
• Content-based similarity yields meaningful cross-sell suggestions even without user interaction logs.

VII. LIMITATIONS
• Transaction data is approximated, which can weaken association-rule signals.
• Model quality depends on text cleanliness and category coverage.
• Evaluation is primarily offline and heuristic-based.

VIII. FUTURE WORK
• Incorporate real transaction or session data when available.
• Introduce learning-to-rank for final bundle scoring.
• Add personalization using user profiles or browsing history.
• A/B test bundle strategies to validate business impact.

IX. REPRODUCIBILITY AND USAGE
Open the notebook:
• notebooks/bundle_recommendation_solution.ipynb

Packages:
• pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, gensim, mlxtend, nltk

Outputs in the notebook are illustrative; rerun cells end-to-end to regenerate figures and metrics.
