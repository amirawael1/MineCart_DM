Comparison Document: This Work vs. Prior Research

Abstract—This document compares the MineCart_DM bundle and cross-selling system with foundational research in association rules, recommender systems, hybrid recommenders, and word embeddings. It highlights the main differences and the key contributions of our work.

I. SCOPE OF COMPARISON
The comparison focuses on papers cited in the project report:
[1] Agrawal et al., 1993 (SIGMOD)
[2] Agrawal and Srikant, 1994 (VLDB)
[3] Sarwar et al., 2001 (WWW)
[4] Linden et al., 2003 (IEEE Internet Computing)
[5] Burke, 2002 (UMUAI)
[6] Mikolov et al., 2013 (arXiv)
[7] Mikolov et al., 2013 (NeurIPS)

II. KEY POINTS OF OUR WORK
1) Metadata-first recommendation: Works without user–item logs by using titles, categories, prices, ratings, and sales proxies.
2) Hybrid design tailored for bundling: Combines content similarity, category diversity, popularity, and price constraints.
3) Bundle generator with practical constraints: Enforces minimum rating, category diversity, and price ceilings.
4) Association-rule signals without transactions: Uses synthetic baskets to approximate co-purchase patterns.
5) Multi-level evaluation: Measures diversity, coherence, value, and price efficiency for bundles.

III. COMPARISON TABLE (SUMMARY)
Area | Prior Research Focus | Gap in Prior Work | Our Work
-----|----------------------|------------------|---------
Association rules | Co-occurrence from transaction logs | Requires transactions; no semantic similarity or price constraints | Synthetic transactions + semantic similarity + price-aware bundling
Collaborative filtering | User–item interaction similarity | Cold-start and sparse data limitations | Metadata-only similarity from titles and product attributes
Hybrid recommenders | Combining multiple signals, often with user data | Less emphasis on metadata-only pipelines | Hybrid scoring with content, category, and popularity for cross-sell
Word embeddings | General semantic similarity for text | Not applied to price/category constraints in bundling | Word2Vec title vectors fused with price for product similarity

IV. PAPER-BY-PAPER DIFFERENCES
A. Association Rule Mining
[1] and [2] focus on efficient discovery of frequent itemsets and rules from large transaction databases. They do not address semantic similarity between items or pricing constraints.
Our work integrates rule mining signals with content-based similarity and price-aware bundle selection, and introduces synthetic transactions when logs are unavailable.

B. Collaborative Filtering and Item-to-Item Recommendations
[3] and [4] use user–item interactions to compute item similarities. Their core assumption is access to large-scale behavioral data.
Our work does not require interaction data. It computes similarity from product titles (Word2Vec) and augments it with category and popularity features, enabling cross-sell recommendations in metadata-only settings.

C. Hybrid Recommenders
[5] surveys methods that combine multiple recommenders (content, collaborative, knowledge-based). Many examples still depend on user ratings or logs.
Our work builds a hybrid framework without user histories, emphasizing practical bundle constraints (price ceiling, category diversity, minimum rating) that are not central in the survey.

D. Word Embeddings for Text Similarity
[6] and [7] introduce Word2Vec for semantic representations of words and phrases. They do not address recommender objectives or bundling constraints.
Our work applies Word2Vec to product titles, then fuses the embeddings with normalized price to guide product similarity and bundling decisions.

V. CONTRIBUTIONS RELATIVE TO PRIOR WORK
1) Practical bundling constraints: Price ceilings and category diversity are explicitly enforced.
2) Metadata-only pipeline: Operates without user or transaction data.
3) Hybrid scoring tailored to cross-selling: Combines semantic similarity, category overlap, and popularity signals.
4) Bundle evaluation framework: Uses diversity and coherence metrics to assess bundle quality.
5) End-to-end reproducible implementation: Data preparation, modeling, visualization, and evaluation are contained in one notebook.

VI. LIMITATIONS OF OUR APPROACH (IN CONTEXT)
1) Synthetic transactions approximate real co-purchase behavior and may reduce rule quality.
2) Word2Vec embeddings depend on title quality and vocabulary coverage.
3) Evaluation is offline and heuristic-based; online testing is not performed.

VII. CONCLUSION
Compared to prior work, this project emphasizes a metadata-first, constraint-aware, and hybrid approach to bundling and cross-selling. It extends classic association-rule and collaborative-filtering concepts to settings where user logs are sparse or unavailable, while incorporating product semantics, category diversity, and price optimization for practical recommendation outputs.
